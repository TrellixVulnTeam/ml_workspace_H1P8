    "In this representation of your one-sentence document, each row is a vector for a single word. The sentence has 10 words, all unique, and it doesn’t reuse any words. The table has the 10 columns (words in your vocabulary) and 10 rows (words in the document). A \"1\" in a column indicates a vocabulary word that was present at that position in the document. So if you wanted to know what the third word in a document was, you’d go to the third row in the table. And you’d look up at the column heading for the \"1\" value in the third row (the row labeled 2, because the row numbers start at 0). At the top of that column, the seventh column in the table, you can find the natural language representation of that word, \"began\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the table is a binary row vector, and you can see why it’s also called a one-hot vector: all but one of the positions (columns) in a row are 0 or blank. Only one column, or position in the vector is \"hot\" (\"1\"). A one (1) means on, or hot. A zero (0) mean off, or absent. And you can use the vector [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to represent the word \"began\" in your NLP pipeline.\n"
